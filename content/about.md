### About

Hi there! I’m Guilherme Miranda, a Brazilian Android engineer currently working at Joyn (ProSiebenSat.1 Media SE) in Berlin, Germany.  

I started building Android apps back in tech school and have been working with it ever since. Over the years, I’ve helped build products for different areas, from banking to video streaming, always trying to keep things simple, fast, and enjoyable to use.  

Before Joyn, I worked at Accedo.tv on apps like NBC Universal and 1001, and at Banco Inter, one of the biggest digital banks in Brazil. I graduated in Computer Science from the Federal University of Minas Gerais (UFMG).  

These days I focus mostly on Android TV, Kotlin, and Jetpack Compose. I like designing thoughtful solutions and solving real problems through software.  

Outside of work, I enjoy coffee making, running, and experimenting with small side projects.
